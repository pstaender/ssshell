# ssshell is a REPL for SilverStripe

## Like tinker for Laravel - runs on top of Psy Shell ðŸš€

### Install

Go to your SilverStripe (v4+) project root, then type:

```sh
  $ composer require pstaender/ssshell dev-master
```

### Usage

To use ssshell just type `./vendor/bin/sshell` in your project folder, and you'll see some welcome messages like

```sh
  Psy Shell v0.9.9 (PHP 7.3.6 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman
  Welcome to SilverStripeShell v0.0.1 by Philipp Staender
  >>>
```

### Features

`ssshell` comes with a set of [frequent used namespaces](https://github.com/pstaender/ssshell/blob/master/src/SSShell/SilverStripeShell.php#L12) for convenient REPL handling.

As example, creating a SilverStripe User would be:

```sh
  >>> Member::create(['Email' => 'editor', 'Password' => 'supersecret'])->write()
  => 2
  >>> Member::get()->first()
  => SilverStripe\Security\Member {#3229
      +ClassName: "SilverStripe\Security\Member",
      +LastEdited: "2019-07-01 11:34:54",
      +Created: "2019-07-01 11:34:54",
      +Email: "admin",
      +Password: "$2y$10$9b5f51921992948f40cf7uHeqjQLuG9Bnqf4sq54TBnsB80CmwJhC",
      +PasswordEncryption: "blowfish",
      +Salt: "10$9b5f51921992948f40cf75",
      +Locale: "en_US",

      +ID: 1,
      +RecordClassName: "SilverStripe\Security\Member",

        [
          "ClassName" => "SilverStripe\Security\MemberPassword",
          "LastEdited" => "2019-07-01 11:34:54",
          "Created" => "2019-07-01 11:34:54",
          "Password" => "$2y$10$9b5f51921992948f40cf7uHeqjQLuG9Bnqf4sq54TBnsB80CmwJhC",
          "Salt" => "10$9b5f51921992948f40cf75",
          "PasswordEncryption" => "blowfish",
          "MemberID" => 1,
          "ID" => 1,
          "RecordClassName" => "SilverStripe\Security\MemberPassword",
        ],
      ],
      +RememberLoginHashes: [],
      +LinkTracking: [],
      +FileTracking: [],
      +Groups: [],
    }
```
